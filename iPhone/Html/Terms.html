    Vouchers, frequently called "PaidPunches" throughout the Service, that you purchase through our Service, as a PaidPunch account holder, are special
    promotional offers that you purchase from participating Merchants through our service. The vouchers are redeemable for certain goods, services or
    experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the voucher. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the voucher.
    The Merchant is the issuer of the voucher and is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries,
    illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (<b>"Liabilities"</b>) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part,
    whether related to the use or redemption of a voucher or not. You waive and release PaidPunch and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers,
    directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a
    voucher or the services/goods it provides in connection with it.

    <p>
    
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    By purchasing any voucher you agree to the terms of this Agreement and these Terms of Sale. By purchasing, viewing a mobile version, printing,
    accepting, using or attempting to use any voucher, you agree to these Terms of Sale specifically (<b>"rules"</b>), the terms on the voucher itself and
    any additional, specific terms reasonably made clear to you and associated with the voucher at the time of purchase (collectively, the         <b>"fine print"</b> regardless of how labeled). These rules apply to all promotional vouchers that we make available, unless a particular voucherâ€™s
    fine print states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these rules and a voucherâ€™s fine print, the
    voucherâ€™s fine print will control.
    <p>
    
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    PaidPunch is a service provider for the Merchant identified on the voucher and the Merchant is the sole issuer of the voucher.

    <p>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Vouchers have two separate values: (a) the <b>"amount paid"</b> and (b) the promotional value. The <b>"promotional value"</b> is the additional value
    beyond the amount paid. Together, the amount paid and the promotional value equals the <b>"full offer value"</b> of the voucher. For example, if you
    pay $15 for a voucher that gets you $30 of goods or services from a Merchant, the full offer value is $30, the amount paid is $15 (this amount does not
    expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the voucher).
    <p>

    <p>
    <p>
    
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    
    Only one voucher may be used per visit to the Merchant.Another voucher cannot be used at the Merchant until a specified amount of time has elapsed;
    this time is entirely at the discretion of the business and may be any amount of time, but it is typically between 5 and 10 minutes. Vouchers are not
    redeemable for cash. Unauthorized or unlawful reproduction, resale, modification or trade of vouchers is prohibited.
