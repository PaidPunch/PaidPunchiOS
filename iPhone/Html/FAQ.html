<b><font size="3px">What is PaidPunch?</font></b>
<br>
PaidPunch is a fun new way for customers to save money and win prizes at businesses throughout their city. It creates a unique win-win scenario where you,  the customer, get a great discount and the business gets exposure to new customers as well as repeat business. The key to PaidPunch is this cool  thing we've created called a &quot;Punch&quot;.</p><p>
<b><font size="3px">What is a “Punch”?</font></b>
<br />
A Punch is a digital voucher of store credit. Businesses sell them in packs called PaidPunch cards. Punches are used towards your purchase at the business you purchased it from.
</p><p>
<b><font size="3px">What is a “Mystery Punch”?</font></b>
<br />
A Mystery Punch is similar to a Punch in the sense that it has value and is redeemable at the business you bought it from. However, unlike a  regular Punch which has a known value, the  Mystery Punch has a random value that can be  anything from a free drink to $20 cash! It adds a  great twist to using PaidPunch that is fun, rewarding, social and quite addicting!
</p><p>
<b><font size="3px">Give me a scenario.</font></b>
<br />
Okay, sure. Starkey's BBQ sells  4 $1.75 Punches  (a $7 value) for just $2. Plus, they also give you one FREE Mystery Punch which can be anything from a free drink to a free meal. You can even win $20 cash! </p>
<p>So, for your $2 investment, you can get up to $27 worth of value! Talk about a great deal!</p>
<p>
<b><font size="3px">Do I have to spend money to use PaidPunch?</font></b>
<br />
Not at all. Businesses offer free Punches which you can unlock by sharing a post to your Facebook! Then, if you like the business you can take 26 seconds to enter in your credit card information and buy Punches. It's up to you.</p>
<p>
<font size="3px"><b>Is my credit card information kept safe and secure?</b></font>
<br />
Absolutely. Keeping your credit card information secure is our top priority. Without your trust, we cannot operate. That is why we store all of your data in a highly secure offsite location with the industry leader in credit card processing, Authorize.net. All sensitive information is sent across a secure 256-bit encrypted connection.</p>
<p>
  <b><font size="3px">How</font><font size="3px"> did PaidPunch start? What's the story?</font></b>
  <br />
PaidPunch was started by two University of San Diego students on a mission to create a service that gives great deals to consumers while generating profitable repeat business for businesses.</p>
